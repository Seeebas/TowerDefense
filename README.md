# Tower Defense 

Hi, this was one of the games that I did with Unity3d and C# in a college subject.

This game consists in a Tower Defense where the player must not allow the enemy to enter into a cave. For that he will need to build some strategy on where he we will place the towers and also the bombs in the world.

All the assets that I use are free, some were downloaded from Unity Assets Store others from Google and some were modified by me.

**NOTE:** Feel free to use or modify this project.
